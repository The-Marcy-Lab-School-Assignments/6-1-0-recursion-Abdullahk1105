# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is a function that calls it self. Recursice functions break the problem down into smaller parts that are easier to manage. The cases are the Base case which is a condition that if it is met the function would stop, this prevents stack overflow. Then we have the recursive case which is breaking the problem down and calling the function on it self to get to the solution.
